Bit manupilation

In this lessone I have been able to learn the diffrence between logical and bit proceseors

generally there are 6 opperation 
& AND opprater takes in 2 argumets if both are 1 it displays 1 else
~ NOT accepts 1 argumet and reverse it 1 to 0 and so on
| OR opprater takes in 2 argumets if are 1 if on or both are 1 else 0
>> Right-shift takes one argument and shifts the bitt to the right
<< Left-shift takes one argumetnt and shifts the bit to the left
^ XOR take in 2 arguments and unlike OR the argument must be Ether one of the argumets must be 1 or 0 to make the argumet 1.
